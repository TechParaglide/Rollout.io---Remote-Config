# Rollout.io – Remote Config

## Overview

Rollout.io – Remote Config is a centralized feature flag and configuration management system that enables applications to control features dynamically at runtime without redeploying code. It supports safe rollouts, instant rollback, and centralized configuration control, improving reliability in production environments.
